## General Information
Project background - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue and want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

Business probem the project is trying to solve - required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market

Dataset being used - Bike sharing dataset containing the information about count of bikes rented for years 2018 and 2019.

## High level Conclusions
- People usually prefer to use bikes when temperature is not cold i.e. temperature is conducive for bike riding.
- The demand for bike-sharing system is increasing on yearly basis, as demand was more in 2018 than 2019.
- On days When windspeed is high, the count of the people using bikes goes down as people avoid bike riding in high windy conditions.
- People do not prefer such weather conditions (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds)
